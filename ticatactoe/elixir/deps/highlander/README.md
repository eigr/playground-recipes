# Highlander

There can only be one (process in your cluster)! (h/t [@tuxified](https://github.com/tuxified) for the name)

Highlander ensures that your process only runs once in your system. It is based on erlang's `:global`.

The entire library is only about 50 lines of code, and has no additional dependencies.

# [Read the documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/highlander/Highlander.html#content) for usage instructions.
